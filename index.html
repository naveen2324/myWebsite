                        <br><p>
                            Developed a Java application that uses a two-phase commit protocol to interface with Oracle Content Management (OCM), which runs on Opensearch, a NoSQL database:
                            <br><br>• Efficiently update documents and their corresponding denormalized subdocuments as one cohesive unit within OCM.
                            <br><br>• Implemented a thread utilizing parallel programming techniques that periodically monitors if transactions have stalled
                            or crashed.
                            <br><br>• Automatically perform recovery/rollback of stalled or failed OCM transactions and perform server restart.
